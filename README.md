# CpStuff

This is my personal repositry.

The projects that are here range from simple class-task, minor projects and larger projects(done and ongoing)

ProgrammingADV is a mixture of class-tasks for my time studying at Axevalla Folkh√∂gskola with a bit of attempts at this years Advent of Code

Unity Branch is current and old projects made in Unity, with the old and "finished" being Kitchen Chaos and the current one is Axevalla Arkad.

Feel free to download the Zip file and give it a try, as it's the version of the game without added multiplayer feature, while the folder inside of unity is the non-compiled version of the game that includes some changes and added multiplayer.
