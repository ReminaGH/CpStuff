# CpStuff

This is my personal repositry.

The projects that are here range from simple class-task, minor projects and larger projects(done and ongoing)

ProgrammingADV is a mixture of class-tasks for my time studying at Axevalla Folkh√∂gskola with a bit of attempts at this years Advent of Code

Unity Branch is current and old projects made in Unity, with the old and "finished" being Kitchen Chaos and the current one is Axevalla Arkad.

The 2 zip files for Kitchen Chaos are different builds, the first one being the version without added multiplayer feature and the other being most updated(and WIP) due to fully adding functional multiplayer and then later trying to add more customization, but stopped half-way to start on another projekt(hence not able to change colors in multiplayer due to trying to change the way the rendering method for the models)

Axevalla Akrad is the current project for my class, which is me trying to create a user friendly way for everyone in my class to put in their games and launching them indivudually through a cabinet. The whole project has been me experimenting with different methods of saving, launchng and storing data between games that later can be easily understood by someone who isn't me.
